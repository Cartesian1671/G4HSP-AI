# G4HSP-AI
2223-KEN4153 Maastricht University 2023

Each section is a progression from the experience of the previous.
There is overlap in  scripts, based on the need to nromalize new and more data,in order to enhance accuracy, precision, recall and TP/TF ratios through the various goal topics, G4 and HSP interaction.

Section 5 is the FAIR metadata  and is the XML on the G4HSP-AI directory rather than  a script module.
Secction 6 is the arrival of a working SVM based on NLTK (but it was compared with SPACY.  SpaCY was removed as it does not qualify for academic research.)

Please consider this repository as the host of results for research "exploration" .
Results are visible in each cell of the scripts.


Watch for  final versioining:  this will include an interactive knowledge graph with SparQL and an interactive AI for searching virus G4-HSP interaction that can be used in medical pathogenomic research.  It will be announced in the  peer-reviewed journal publication.
